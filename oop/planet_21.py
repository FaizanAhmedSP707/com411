# I previously created the class Planet that allowed us to add humans and robots to a planet.
# These were stored in a dictionary.  Now that I have the class Inhabitant, I no longer need a dictionary
# or indeed separate methods for humans and robots.  This is because I can now store a single list of inhabitants.
# We can always check whether an inhabitant is a human or a robot using the function isinstance.

from human_2-1 import Human
